# FusionXR
A all in one VR Toolkit.

This has the goal of setting a open standard for VR. Many Problems already have solutions, so why figure them out yourself?
My goal is it to compile a large set of tools so developers can focus on making games instead of worrying about interactions, systems, etc.
I hope to find many contributers to this project and anyone that has some code from a old project, ideas for improvement or even brand new additions to this set is invited to share them with me. I will try to integrate everything I can get, so even if you only have some old code that might help, just throw it my way and I will try the best I can do to make it availabe. :)
